# My basic Finance Dashboard project. 

Essentially, it's a basic finance dashboard using React, Bootstrap, and Chart.js with PropTypes for type-checking with react for validation, and it's compatible with mobile. 

There's short explanations of code within my code for new beginners as well, hope this helps!
